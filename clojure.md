Clojure is a dialect for Lisp. It is a hosted langauge. Clojure programs are translated to Java Bytecode and then executed
by JVM. Clojure relies on JVM for features such as threading and garbage collection.



```
user=> (str "Carnegie" "Mellon")
"CarnegieMellon"
```

Clojure 'statements' or expressions are also called as forms.
```
user=> [1 2 3]
[1 2 3]
```
```
user=> 1
1
```
```
user=> "random string"
"random string"
```
```
user=> ["string" "vector"]
["string" "vector"]
```

Conditionals
```
user=> (if true
  #_=>     "this is true"
  #_=>     "this is false"
  #_=> )
"this is true"
```
```
user=> (if false
  #_=>     "this is true"
  #_=>     "this is false"
  #_=> )
"this is false"
```

```
user=> (if false
  #_=>     "blah"
  #_=> )
nil
```
In Clojure, each branch of the if statement can have only one form. So to have multiple forms in a conditional branch, we use 
the do statement.
