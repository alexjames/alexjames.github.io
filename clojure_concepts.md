# Functional programming concepts

### Pure functions
Pure functions are functions that have no side-effects. They will always return the same result if they are provided the same 
arguments. They have no 'state'. They can't cause any changes that are observable outside of it. For example, they can't 
mutate an external object or write to a file.
