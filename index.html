This is my personal online journal of stuff. Mostly CS stuff. But there might be other stuff as well. Someday. Maybe. I cannot assure 
that everything here is factually correct. But since this site is meant as a reference for me, I'll try to correct myself as soon 
as I'm made aware of my blunders. All opinions expressed are mine and mine alone. You are free to borrow my opinions.

  <h1>Computer Science</h1>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.categories.cs %}
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  

  <h1>Brief Excursions</h1>
This is where I document things I play around with. These do not follow a set theme, nor are they meant to be 
particularly insightful.
