This is my personal online journal of stuff. Mostly CS stuff. But there might be other stuff as well. Someday. Maybe. I cannot assure 
that everything here is factually correct. But since this site is meant as a reference for me, I'll try to correct myself as soon 
as I'm made aware of my blunders.

  <h1>Computer Science</h1>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.categories.cs %}
      <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
