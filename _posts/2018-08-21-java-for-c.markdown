A JAR is a Java Archive which is a ZIP with UTF-8 filenames that stores all the classes of an application or a library. 

A WAR file is a "Web Application Archive" which is basically a JAR containing all the files a web application
needs to run. A WAR may be structured as:
```
index.html
myapp.jsp
WEB-INF/classes/MyApp.class
WEB-INF/web.xml
```

Packages are separated organized into separate folders and files so that there is a clear delineation of namespace.
