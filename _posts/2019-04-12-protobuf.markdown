When you interact with a web application, there are two primary kinds of data transfers that happen. One is the transfer of
data from the user (or client) to the server. The other is between servers.

The considerations you have to make while deciding how to send data over the wire are:
  * Transmission medium
  * What protocol to use?
  * What format should the data be in?
  * Size and efficiency of the data being transmitted
  * How much data actually needs to be sent for the endpoint to do its job
