Datacenters are the powerhouse of the information age. They constitute the physical servers on which all major 
computation and storage needed by today's websites, mobile apps and web services occur.

# Power
A typical server will waste a third of the power supplied to in before any of it actually reaches it's components.
The major source of this loss is the power supply that converts AC to DC voltages. The next major loss is cause by
the voltage regulator.


PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) is a term indicating how much of power is consumed to cool and distribute/convert power
in a data center. PUE = 2.0 means that for every Watt of power consumed, another Watt is the cooling and power
overhead. A PUE of 1.0 is ideal and means that all power was used for computing. PUE is heavily influenced by weather,
which is why the values tend to be lower in cooler seasons.
