I've recently (Jan 2018) been interviewing for security engineer positions. I couldn't find a good resource for security interview prep.
Unlike software engineering prep, there's no Crack The Coding Interview or LeetCode that I'm aware that help with interview prep. For the 
most part, I wasn't sure about what to expect. So I spent a lot of time Googling through "security interview questions" and created this
list of popular questions and topics you're expected to know and have added my own answers to those questions. This is by no means an
exhaustive list.
