I've recently (Jan 2018) been interviewing for security engineer positions. I couldn't find many resources for security interview prep.
Unlike software engineering interviews, there's no Crack The Coding Interview or LeetCode that I'm aware that help with preparing for
interviews for technical security positions. For the most part, I wasn't sure about what to expect. So I spent a lot of time Googling 
through "security interview questions", talked to friends who have interviewed for these positions before and created this list of popular
questions and topics you're expected to know about. I have added my own answers to those questions. This is by no means an exhaustive list,
nor are my answers complete. I'm documenting these primarily for my own reference. You'll likely be hired for your actual competence, than 
your ability to regurgitate security jargon. But you don't want to be in a position where you can't recall how an XSS attack works. A shout-out
to @tnballo for helping me compile and clearly express some of these ideas.

###### What is XSS?
XSS stand for Cross-site scripting.
