# Reasoning about Infrastructure Security
### General Idea
The idea with infrastrucutre security is pretty straight forward. You have a bunch of computing resources in your corporate
environment which you want to protect from outside attackers. At the same time, you also want to protect your own users
from themselves - from misconfiguring their services that bring down the entire network, from accidentally deleting
production images or an upset employee hellbent on wreaking havoc on their last day.

### What we hope to accomplish
Here are our goals:
 * Who is accessing what
 * The identities of everyone involved
 * Ensuring only those who have the right to perform an action can perform it

### Enumerating Your Resources
What are the things we want to protect? In 2018, this probably means your production servers, corporate laptops and physical
hardware on-site.

### Ways of Accomplishing This
 * Firewalls
 * VPN
 * Proxies (forward and reverse)
 * SSH
