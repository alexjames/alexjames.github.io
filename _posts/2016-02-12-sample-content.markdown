You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```
I want this in a blcok
```

This is sparta
 * df
 * nl

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

```
lalala
df
df
```

# The Practice of Programming

1. Simplicity, clarity and generality form the bedrock of good software.

2. Good code has...
  * straightforward logic
  * natural expression
  * conventional language use
  * meaningful names
  * neat formatting
  * helpful comments
  * avoid clever tricks and unusual constructs


3. Macro lol lol lol names should not indicate specific values. The name will also need to be changed later if the use changes.


```
Don't:
#define ONE 1
#define TEN 10

Do:
#define INPUT_MODE 1
#define BUFFER_SIZE 10
```
