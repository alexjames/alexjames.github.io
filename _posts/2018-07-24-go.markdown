Go is a modern langauge that is steadily gaining in popularity. The language was designed at Google by heavy-weights such as Ken Thompson
and Rob Pike of Plan 9 fame. This is one of the languages I've had to pickup at my new job, so I took the opportunity to learn more about 
the language.

Types

UTF-8 Encoding: all the characters of source code are UTF-8 encoding. This means you can write something like this in
source code:
```
  fmt.Print("你好，世界")
```
   
```
import main

package "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Print("Hello World!")
}
```
 
 In Go, a type implements an interface by defining the required methods.
 
 Go programs are composed of packages. Every program's main method is in the *main* package.
 
 The general syntax for a Go function is as follows:

```
func function_name([list of parameters]) [return_types] {
    // function body 
}


// Simple function that adds two numbers
package main

import "fmt"

func add(a int, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Sum is", add(6,9))
}
```
