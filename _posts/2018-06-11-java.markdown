# Java
A quick Java recap. Mostly summarized from the Oracle Java trail.

## Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
### Object
Objects are the bed-rock of OOP. An object is the software representation of an entity with it's state and associated behavior.
State is stored in `fields` and behavior is accessed through `methods`.

### Class
A class is the template used for creating an object. You use classes to instantiate objects.

```
public class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    void setName(String new_name){
        name = new_name;
    }
}
```
### Inheritance
Objects may be grouped together based on similarity in state and behavior. For example, mountain bikes, road bikes and 
hybrid bikes are types of bikes. So you have all three classes share a lot of the common state and behavior of a class bike.
Thus we can have `MountainBike` inherit from class `Bike`. Here, Bike is the superclass and MountainBike is the subclass.
In Java, each subclass can have only one superclass. But a superclass can have an unlimited number of subclasses.

```
class MountainBike extends Bike {

}
```
