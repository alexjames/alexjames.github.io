  My name is Alex James. I am currently a Masters student studying Information 
  Security at Carnegie Mellon University and hold a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. My interests lie primarily in large-scale 
  system design, computer systems and secure architecture.

  
  My hobbies include reading, photography and travelling. You'll find me frequently loafing around at 
  <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/">Cylab</a>, especially when board game night is on.
